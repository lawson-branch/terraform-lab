# Detailed documentation of our previous assignment @nexedgetechnologies.

## I started the assignment by creating a terraform branch named "tf-branch-b".

## Two additional subnets were provisioned for the already existing (my-vpc) network in different regions with firewall configuration for both subnets (lawson-subnet1 and lawson-subnet2).

### I created two VM's "lawson-vm1" and "lawson-vm2" with a provision of two subnets (lawson-subnet1 and lawson-subnet2)and the use of two different images "Ubuntu/debian".

#### Furtheremore, I created to cloud storage buckets (lawsonbucket1.tf and lawsonbucket2.tf)

##### Lastly, I created two database instances ( MySQL database instance and PostgresQL database instance) in different locations.

##### I finished my work by pushing all the above created resouces to my github account, I added two contributors and requested for a review of my pull request.
